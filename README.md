### Media Repository Template

This template can be used to create a personal media repository. All images uploaded into the images folder can be accessed via a URL. The same is true for the audio folder.

See the [instructions.md](https://github.com/kam535/image-host-template/blob/main/instructions.md) file for instructions on how to set up your media repository.
